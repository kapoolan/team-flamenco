#Project Overview
We're a team that's creating a platform for people to play party games on. More specifically, we're planning on building an engine that can allow users to easily create simple games, play them with their friends, and share them online. We're focused on making the game creation easy via a drag-and-drop interface. Game playing will be even easier. No matter who you've brought along, everyone can quickly join the fun with little hassle.

#Proposal Overview
Our proposal expands on our project ideas, and describes our motivation and mindset coming into the project. The expected development timeline and costs are detailed there as well.
