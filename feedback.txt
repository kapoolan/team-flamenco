# Project 01 Feedback

Your logo is great. If you could update your courses to also include
the name of the course it will make it easier for us to understand and
review. You do not provide enough detail regarding your general idea
or interest in this document. It is difficult to know exactly what you
are focusing on. You answered the "why" part in your slogan. But, you
need more detail. Please update this document. We will review it again
when we review P02.

You successfully used git and github to organize your project and you
created the docs directory correctly. Currently, you do not have any
activity on your Trello board and the activity on github is low
especially since P02 is due today. You must make sure to show more
activity as low activity will hurt your grade. 

At this time I give your submission the following rating:

**Weak Thumbs Up**

I hope to see more progress in Project 02. In particular:

* Trello board activity
* Github activity
* Updated profile.md to include general direction and idea.
